# Reinstall

This is done as described on the [home page](https://track2p.github.io/home.html) (and the [GitHub readme](https://github.com/juremaj/track2p)):

To reinstall, open anaconda and remove the environment with:

```
conda env remove -n track2p
```

Then follow the 'Installing via pip' instructions above :)

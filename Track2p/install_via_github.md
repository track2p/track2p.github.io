# Install via GitHub

Alternatively track2p can also be installed directly from the Github repository (this is currently discouraged, since the repo is under active development).
To install via Github run:

```
conda create --name track2p python=3.9
conda activate track2p
git clone https://github.com/juremaj/track2p
cd track2p
pip install -e .
```
